# Trade War Simulation - Development Plan

This document outlines the detailed development plan for expanding the Trade War Simulation project with new features and capabilities.

## Recent Achievements: Randomized Strategy Combinators

We have successfully implemented a powerful, composable system for building trade war strategies that incorporate randomness. This opens up a whole new dimension of strategy design, allowing for:

- **Probabilistic decision making**: Strategies can now make decisions based on probability distributions
- **Weighted strategy selection**: Choose between multiple strategies with configurable weights
- **Random exploration of strategy space**: Enable strategies that can explore different options randomly
- **Reproducible randomness**: Fixed seeds for testing and reproducible simulations
- **Pure functional approach**: Using MonadRandom for clean, composable randomized strategies

These new capabilities enable more realistic modeling of real-world trade policy decision-making, which often involves uncertainty, mixed strategies, and probabilistic thinking. This is especially relevant for modeling the current US-Canada trade tensions.
